# GPA Buddy

> Grade Point Averages Made Easy!

> [!WARNING]

This project was constructed to help visualize your transcript history and give _you_ a better understanding of your grades.
Be warned though, It also has a potency for creating **academic weapons**

Just login, upload your transcript, and get analytics and patterned data right away!
